# Excel-Coffee-Sales-Dashboard
An analysis of coffee sales using Excel data from three orders, customers, and products tables. Data was combined and cleaned up using XLOOKUP and INDEX MATCH and then translated into Pivot Charts. These charts were then displayed on a dashboard with slicers to help filter the sales data by period, roast type, size, and loyalty card.
